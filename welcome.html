        <h3>Climate Information:</h3>
        <p>With Brazil being such a large country, it's climate varies considerably from north to south. That being said, 60% of it's land mass lies within a tropical climate, meaning some toasty temperatures and lots of rainfall year round.
        </p>
    </br>
    <h3>What to Wear:</h3>
    <p>With Brazil's warm temperatures, you should definitely bring light clothes, both in color and fabric. In Brazil, when it rains it pours! So make sure to bring rainproof clothing and a few ponchos while you're at it. The sun is bright here, so make sure to pack at least one pair of shades and a wide-brimmed hat. Visiting the jungle or rainforest? It'd be a good idea to wear long cotton clothing to protect yourself from critter bites.</p>
